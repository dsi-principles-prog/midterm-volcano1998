# Predicting the Onset of Diabetes Within Five Years with Machine Learning


## Background


Diabetes Mellitus affects 382 million people in the world, and the number of people with type-2 diabetes is increasing in every country. Untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.

For easier diagnosis,data mining and machine learning is employed to bridge the gap between huge data sets and human knowledge. We can begin to apply machine learning techniques for classification in a dataset that describes a population that is under a high risk of the onset of diabetes.


## About the study

The population for this study was the **Pima Indian population** near Phoenix, Arizona. The population has been under continuous study since 1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases because of its high incidence rate of diabetes.

For the purposes of this dataset, diabetes was diagnosed according to World Health Organization Criteria, which stated that if the 2 hour post-load glucose was at least 200 mg/dl at any survey exam or if the Indian Health Service Hospital serving the community found a glucose concentration of at least 200 mg/dl during the course of routine medical care.

Given the medical data we can gather about people, we should be able to make better predictions on how likely a person is to suffer the onset of diabetes, and therefore act appropriately to help. We can start analyzing data and experimenting with algorithms that will help us study the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians.
     
     
## About the data

**data source**

It is initially published in *UCI Machine Learning Repository* , but for some reason now it can only be found in other website, such as

## Problem (the goal of modeling)

How to predict the oneset of diabetes within 5 years?
(i.e.  how to define the model, which can predict the oneset of diabetes within 5 years)
